# About Me

I design and build **large-scale, enterprise-ready, high-performance financial systems** used in production environments where correctness, resilience, and speed matter. My work spans system design, hands-on engineering, and long-term platform evolution in regulated domains.

I place strong emphasis on **clean, maintainable architecture**—clear domain boundaries, explicit data contracts, and model-driven design. I optimise for systems that remain understandable and adaptable as complexity, scale, and regulatory demands increase.

A significant part of my work focuses on **data analytics, complex data modelling, and financial mathematics**—including forecasting, liquidity, risk, and regulatory calculations. I enjoy translating mathematically rich problem spaces and large datasets into precise, explainable, and production-grade implementations.

I work with a **prototype-to-production mindset**, leveraging modern cloud platforms, data tooling, and AI techniques to move quickly while preserving architectural discipline, observability, and operational robustness.
