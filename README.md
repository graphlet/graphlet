## Hi there 👋

<!--
I build large-scale, enterprise-ready, high-performance financial systems—the kind that need to be correct, resilient, and fast under real-world load. My background sits at the intersection of engineering, architecture, and finance.

I care deeply about clean, maintainable architecture. I favour well-defined boundaries, explicit models, and systems that are easy to reason about, evolve, and operate—especially in regulated, long-lived environments.

Much of my work involves complex data modelling and financial calculations: liquidity, risk, forecasting, and regulatory metrics. I enjoy turning messy, domain-heavy problems into precise, testable, production-grade logic.

I’m a hands-on technologist with a strong prototype-to-production mindset, using modern cloud, data, and AI tools to deliver systems that scale—technically and organisationally.
