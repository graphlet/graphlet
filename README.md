# About Me

I build **large-scale, enterprise-ready, high-performance financial systems**, with a CTO’s focus on longevity, correctness, and operational excellence. My work spans architecture, engineering strategy, and hands-on delivery in highly regulated environments.

I have a strong bias for **clean, maintainable architecture**—clear domain models, well-defined boundaries, and systems designed to scale both technically and organisationally. I care as much about how systems evolve as how they perform on day one.

My core expertise sits in **AI- and data-centric platforms**, complex data modelling, and financial calculations—turning large, imperfect datasets and sophisticated financial logic into explainable, production-grade systems.

I operate with a **prototype-to-production mindset**, using AI, modern cloud platforms, and disciplined engineering practices to move ideas quickly while keeping them enterprise-safe, observable, and resilient.
